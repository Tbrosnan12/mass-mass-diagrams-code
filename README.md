This code will take in a pulsar paramter file (.par) and create a mass-mass diagram for the pulsar and its binary companion based on the predicted values of the post Keplerian parameters by GR.

The code is called by running: python mass.py parfile.par

The par file will need the specific parameters to create the graph

Extra files in here are test pulsar data
